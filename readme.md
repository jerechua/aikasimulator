This is a skill simulator for a mmorpg called Aika online.

## React

To use the react webpage, it needs to be served, otherwise you'll get
CORS errors for `file://`.

An easy to way to serve the files is to start a webserver using:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Then on your browser, navigate to `localhost:8000`
